			The Santa Fe Independent School District sent a letter to the community to offer support following today’s shooting. In the letter, Santa Fe school district said, “Today is a day to be in mourning those we have lost and nursing those who are hurt. We are in this together.” Dimitrios Pagourtzis, identified as the Texas high school shooter, was known for a distinctive piece of clothing, one of his classmates told CNN."I've talked to him once or twice. I had my advisory class, which is after third period, with him," Santa Fe High student Mateo Twilley said. "He was really quiet and he wore like a trench coat almost every day." He was hiding a shotgun underneath such a coat on Friday morning when he walked onto the campus, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said at news conference Friday afternoon. Ten people were killed in the shooting -- nine students and a teacher.
